from the pdf I used Example 4.2 as second example folder
and the first example is 4.3

&

Const1 is the constant function not (x(t))

but H1is the x(t)

that is for the integration from 0 to s

&

Const2 is the constant function not (x(t))

but H2 is the x(t)

that is for the integration from 0 to 1

&

Lambda1 &  Lambda2
as you can tell is the constant before the integration

&

and y is the non integration equation
